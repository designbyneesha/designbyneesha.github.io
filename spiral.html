My initial task involved researching and identifying which subgroup of this demographic I thought could benefit the most from such a tool. 
                <br><br>I would then need to conduct the necessary research concerning my target audience, and construct a proposal pitch consisting of relevant user personas and service mockups.

            <h4 class="h4--description">The functional requirements for the design brief were dictated by a competitive analysis of existing study services, which identified task, time, and content management tools as key ingredients. Thus, the feature requirements were split into three main components:

                <br><br>I also chose to re-use familiar component styles and visuals from popular coding services that students mentioned in my online ethnography (e.g. GitHub, VSCode, LeetCode). 
                Since the majority of students would either be learning or working on these platforms, utilising a similar visual style would allow students to feel more comfortable in the Spiral.io environment, 
                as well as mentally compartmentalise their work.
                <br><br>Based on my research, I also decided on a dark palette to reduce eye strain for nocturnal developers, and an off-black base to avoid high contrast.

                <br><br> I created a development roadmap for myself to allocate time blocks for high-priority items, and push less relevant site features to
                the end of the timeline.
                <br><br> I chose not to utilise any third-party libraries for the project, as a personal learning challenge for myself, so I prioritised the development
                of a vanilla Kanban Board and Pomodoro Timer.

            <h4 class="h4--description">
                Implementing the drag-and-drop functionality for the board was done by creating a task object and appending each one to its respective parent board. Defining a valid drop-zone as a parent with "kanban-board" class
                ensured that no illegal drops were accepted, and also allowed for hover state interactivity.
                <br><br>A big challenge I had was color-coding category labels, as I wanted categories with the same name to be the same color. To implement this, I had to create a new category object and validate each name during my addTask() function.
                For each unique label, I appended a programmatically-calculated label color to the category object, so any future category with the same name would reference that same color label.

            <h4 class="h4--description">
                The timer was also tough to make responsive, as changing the element size itself broke the precise padding for the stroke-dasharray calculations I had made.
                <br><br>After much tinkering, I decided the best way to ensure nothing broke was to dynamically calculate the timer padding proportionally to the screen width, and retain the actual size of the timer itself.
                <br><br>As for the dictionary, I implemented it stylistically the way I had intended, however after much online research I failed to find an API for coding keywords that was free and worked the way I intended. 
                Ideally, I would have liked an API that had definitions for popular methods and functions for frontend languages, but this didn't seem to exist yet. So instead, I opted for a normal dictionary API.

            <h2 class="header__title">Modifications & Final Thoughts</h2>
            <h4 class="h4--description">Some site components underwent several minor changes between the mockup and final design process, some of which included:
                <div class="bullet-list">
                    <b><span class="text--yellow">Embedding a Spotify music player</span></b> ensured fast site load times as opposed to a vanilla music player. I originally had implemented a simple music player without the use of an external iframe, but wanted to include a variety of tracks so users wouldn't get annoyed by the repetition. This would have been problematic to implement without Spotify, as the repository wouldn't have been as lightweight.
                    <br><br><b><span class="text--yellow">Cross-page support for the "Today's Focus" items</span></b> wasn't implemented as I ran out of time and wanted to focus on more essential aspects of the site instead. In the future, I think this would be a valuable feature to implement, as it helps with focus during longer study sessions.
                    <br><br><b><span class="text--yellow">Excluding the "Learn" section</span></b> was the biggest decision I made for my site. The actual functionality of the section simply linked to external resources, and if users wanted to use those websites, they would likely just navigate to the page on the internet themselves
                    The features weren't an integral part of the design brief, and I wanted to focus on polishing more important parts of the website first.
